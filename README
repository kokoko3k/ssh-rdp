ssh-rdp

ssh-rdp.sh is a shell script that aims to allow you to stream the desktop and the 
sound from a remote host with minimum latency and input control over it.
Every input device can be forwarded thanks to netevent.
That means you can even forward your joypads and play remotely.
ssh-rdp has no dedicated "server" counterpart, but of course it needs to have 
some specific packages installed on the remote side.


Requirements:

* Local  and remote user need to access files under /dev/input,
  so make sure they are in the input group.
  You may beed to reboot after changing group membership.

* Local and Remote: bash,ffmpeg,openssh,netevent
* Local:  inotifywait, wmctrl, 
          Optional:mpv + taskset (lower latency but more cpu use).
* Remote: xdpyinfo,pulseaudio

To make it work, first start it with the "inputconfig" option 
and pay attention to what it asks you.
Next, start it with -h parameter alone to see al the options.

There are other tunables you can find in the script.

Drawbacks:
* Due to some pulseaudio shortcomings, sometimes the audio get desyncronized,
  it will recover by itself by speeding up, and you'll hear high-pitched sound.
* Just clicking in the remote window does not pass the control to it, 
  because that is the playuer, so hitting the hotkey is mandatory.
* For remote gaming, turning on cpu encoder may give better 
  results than gpu encoder, if the gpu is already at its limit.

I'm open to suggestions to make this software better!
